HEALTH TABLE MIGRATION - INSTRUCTIONS
========================================

STEP 1: Make sure XAMPP is running
- Open XAMPP Control Panel
- Start Apache (if not already running)
- Start MySQL (if not already running)

STEP 2: Run the migration script
Open your web browser and copy-paste this EXACT URL:

http://localhost/thyro_sight/thyro_sight/update_health_table.php

IMPORTANT: 
- Note the double "thyro_sight/thyro_sight/" in the path
- Use UNDERSCORE (not space)
- Include "http://" at the beginning
- Copy-paste the URL to avoid typos

STEP 3: What you should see
- A nicely formatted page showing the migration progress
- Green checkmarks (✅) for successful column additions
- A summary showing how many columns were added
- Total column count after migration

STEP 4: Verify the migration worked
After running the migration, you can verify by:

Option A: Check in phpMyAdmin
1. Go to: http://localhost/phpmyadmin
2. Select database: thydb
3. Click on table: healthA
4. Click "Structure" tab
5. You should see 20 new columns added

Option B: Run SQL query
Execute this query in phpMyAdmin:
```sql
DESCRIBE healthA;
```
You should see approximately 50+ columns total.

STEP 5: Test form submission
1. Go to: http://localhost/thyro_sight/health-assessment.html
2. Fill out the complete form
3. Submit it
4. Check the database to see if all fields are saved
